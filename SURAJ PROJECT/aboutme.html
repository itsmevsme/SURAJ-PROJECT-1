His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal<br> lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brothe<br>r, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Utta<br>m N<br>agar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] Accor<br>ding to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. <br>He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father to bowl to him.[11]<br>
<br>In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 3<br>0 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cric<br>ket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Shar<br>ma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his<br> son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities me<br>rited more than just playing in gully cricket.</p>

<h1> ABOUT THE LORD KRISHNA </h1><br>

</p>
Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/;[12] Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ])<br> is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and<br> also as the Supreme God in his own right.[13]<i> He is the god of protection, compassion, <br>tenderness, and love;[14][1] and is widely revered among Hindu divinities.[15] Krishna<br>'s birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the <br>lunisolar Hindu calendar,</i> which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.[16][17][18]<br>

<u>The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled <br>as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Bra<br>hma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical,<br> theological, and mythological texts.[19] They portray him in various perspective<br>s: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme <br>being.[20]</u> His iconography reflects <b>these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, <br>such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with <br>Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.[21]</b>
